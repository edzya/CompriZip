When Madam Pompadour was on a ballroom floor
Said all the gentlemen obviously,
"The madam has the cutest personality"
And think of all the books about Du Barry's looks
What was it made her the toast of Paris?
She had a well-developed personality

What did Romeo see in Juliet?
Or Pierrot in Pierrette? Or Jupiter in Juno?
You know

And when Salome danced
And had the boys entranced, no doubt
It must have been easy to see
That she knew how to use her personality

A girl can learn to spell and take dictation well
And never sit on the boss's settee
Unless she's got a perfect personality
A girl can get somewhere in spite of stringy hair
Or even just a bit bowed at the knees
If she can show a faultless personality

Why are certain girls offered certain things
Like sable coats and wedding rings?
By men who wear their spats right?
That's right!

So don'tcha say, "I'm smart and have the kindest heart"
Or, "What a wonderful sister I'd be"
Just tell me, how you like my personality!
Baby, you've got the cutest personality
